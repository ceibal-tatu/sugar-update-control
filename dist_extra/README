python-distutils-extra can be used with python's distutils or the enhanced
setuptools.

1. DISTUTILS

To make use of the distutils extenstions, you have to import the corresponding methods at the beginning of your setup.py:

from DistUtilsExtra.command import *

Furthermore you have to map the methods to the extended ones:

cmdclass = { "build" : build_extra.build_extra,
             "build_i18n" :  build_i18n.build_i18n }

If you have replaced the default build command by build_extra and defined the other commands e.g. build_i18n, the sub commands e.g. will be called automatically. There is no need to enable them in the setup.cfg anymore (This was require in a previous version). Disabling imported commands in the setup.cfg is still possible:

[build]
i18n=False

See the setup.cfg.example for a more complex layout.

Currently there are the following extensions available:

build_extra: initiates the extensions
build_i18n: provides gettext integration
build_icons: installs icons
build_help: installs a docbook based documentation

2. SETUPTOOLS

Just enable the corresponding build target in the setup.cfg:

[build]
i18n=True
help=True
icons=True

No further imports or modifications are required.

I hope that this code could help you to make your live easier,
