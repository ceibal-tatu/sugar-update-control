* Popup alert when downloads fail.
* Popup alert when activity installation fails.
* Activity pinning: add support in microformat for a 'pin' property,
  and forbid upgrades past that point (if a group file so marks it)
* Use different URL for default G1G1 group?
  (check whether current URL can be protected in the wiki)
* Add url/zipfile support for sugar.bundle.
* Fix sugar.bundle's uninstall() method so that it doesn't assume that
  current bundle's install dir is the same as the previous one's.
  It should also rename the dir to allow for different versions of the
  same activity to be resident. (dlo trac #7494)
* Add support for base OS upgrades
* Add support for library content bundles.
* Add support for language packs?
* Translations!
* Automatically open this control panel on first-boot of a new base OS.
  (dlo trac #7495)
* Be careful about caching large files in urlrange, since the cache is
  in memory (/tmp, a tmpfs).
* check network connection, and wait if first-boot open. (trac #7947)
* display alert if 'some network operations failed'
* display alert if installation failed, and some way to find out how/why
  or which.  (maybe turn the checkbox into an exclamation mark by the
  side of the failing activities and disable them?)
* proxy support?  See site-packages/wikipediafs/http.py and the environment
  variables in 'info wget' search for http_proxy.
* better interrupt/timeout support in http connection: currently we have
  to wait until a chunk of 64k bytes has downloaded, and if the connection
  is slow or hung, this can take a while.
* support library bundles
* fix translation domain
* track down X crash?
